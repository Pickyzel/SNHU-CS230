The Gaming Room is a company who asked for a web-based application of their already successful game Draw It or Lose it. Within the design document, I find that I did well in finding the requirements and constraints that were needed to continue the design process. During the designing process, I found looking at different kinds of examples to be helpful. Wither the example is just showing cost-effectiveness or if it showed how switching something could help secure your application even further. If I could choose something to improve on it would be the information that I provided about the server side. When I got further into the course, I got the chance to read more about cloud storage and would of like to incorporate that into the document more. When interpreting the userâ€™s needs, I tried to visualize what the user would be experiencing based on the information the client had given. The importance of this step is what helps to determine the user's experience and then the success of the application itself. When designing software applications, I found the UML diagrams to be one of the most important parts. It not only does it map out the coding process for the developer but also gives a visual so that the client can see how the application will run and can help with any changes that may need to be done.
